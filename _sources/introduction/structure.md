# Course Structure

The aim of this course is to offer a *taster* of some practical computational chemistry techniques. 
However, before this, it is necessary to develop the skills to handle these techniques, and the most important skill for a modern computational chemistry is **programming**. 
Therefore, the structure of this course is well represented with the following figure.

In additional to being and important skill, learning to program will also help in other ways:
- you will be more capable of understanding **what** the computer is doing and **why**, 
- you will learn how to deconstruct a problem into it's constituent parts and build an *algorithm* from these, 
- programming is generally a useful skill to have (both in chemistry and outside)

We will be introducing the Python from the basics (so you won't need to remember the Python labs in years 1 and 2), and equip you with the tools to tackle *real* chemical problems computationally. 

## How to work in this course?

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on teaching across the University, and this module is no exception. 
In 2019-2020, the CH40208 was completely rewritten to account for a change from teaching [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) in the chemistry degree to Python. 
This year, we have again been forced to rewrite the course, in order to make the most of the remote learning opportunities. 

The majority of the time, this resource will be used for asynchronous learning. 
You will be expected to work through the material at your own pace, completing the exercise as necessary. 
Twice a week, there will be online workshops with the lecturers (Mondays and Fridays at 10:15), where they will work through some example content, and there will be a chance to ask questions directly. 
Attendance at these workshops is strongly advised. 
Additionally, throughout the week, demonstrators will be available to help by email/video calls. 
If you have a question for a demonstrator, email xxx.comp.help@bath.ac.uk](mailto:) and include "CH40208" in the subject, a demonstrator or one of the lecturers will be in touch as soon as they can.
