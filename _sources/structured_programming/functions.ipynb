    "Frequently in programming, there is a piece of code that you want to reuse, after all, one of the major utilities of writing some program to perform an action is the task automation that is possible.\n",
    "Python (along with most programming languages) allows *functions* to be written. \n",
    "These are segments of code to which *arguments* are passed and some operation is performed. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have already encountered a few examples of functions, such as `print()` and `type()`. \n",
    "However, now we will see how you can write your functions. \n",
    "A function is easily recognised in Python, as it is some statement followed immediately by a set of brackets (which contain the arguments). \n",
    "\n",
    "This general syntax for *defining* a Python function is as follows."

    "- **Docstring**: This is the content between the triple quotation marks (`\"\"\"`). This contains documentation about what the function does, including the arguments (`Args:`) and what is returned (`Returns:`).\n",
    "- **Content**: This is the code of the function, in the example above, this is just one line (`ke = 0.5 * mass * velocity ** 2`), however, it can be very long.\n",
    "- **Return**: The information that is returned from the function is passed with the command `return`. The `kinetic_energy` function returns the `ke` variable in the line `return ke`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Whitespace and indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Python takes whitespace and indentation very seriously. \n",
    "It is used to identify a *block*; such as a function. \n",
    "The function content begins when the indented section starts and ends when the indentation is removed. \n",
    "In the function above, the docstring, content and return of the function are all with this block, if the whitespace is removed, then Python will consider the function completed at this point. \n",
    "The indentation can be any length (although 4 spaces are the most commonly found), but it needs to be consistent. \n",
    "Through this course, we will encounter quite a few examples of other *blocks*, when you come across these try to take note of the importance of the whitespace that is used. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is defined using the command `def`, which tell the Python interpreter that a function definition is occurring in that line. \n",
    "The function definition consists of a function name followed by brackets, some arguments (although not essential), and a colon. \n",
    "The number of arguments that a function may have can be anything from 0 to infinity (although the latter is obviously impractical). \n",
    "If a function has no arguments, the brackets are still necessary, although there will be nothing between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to arguments, a function may also have keyword arguments. \n",
    "These are arguments that have *default* values given in the function definition that may be changed when the function is called.\n",
    "An example of a keyword argument is shown below."

    "The doctstring is an important (although not essential) component of any function. \n",

    "Using a standard style of docstring is very useful when writing larger software packages, due to the availablity of tools that will automatically generate formatted documentation from the docstrings. \n",
    "The Google style indicates the arguments with the keyword `Args` before listing the arugments, their expected type and a short description. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Content\n",
    "\n",
    "The content of a function is relatively straight forward, it is the code that makes the function do something. \n",

    "This is an aspect of programming known as *scope*. \n",

    "For example, the variable `concentration` is defined in the `beer_lambert` function above, but nowhere else in the code. \n",
    "Therefore, that variable's scope is only within the `beer_lambert` function block and cannot be used outside of it. \n",
    "Variables defined outside of a function can be used within the function, but *only* if they are defined before the function is defined, as a piece of Python code is interpreted from top-to-bottom.\n",
